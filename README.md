## Summary
The citi bike data collected shows most bike trips were under 20 minutes, with men using the bike service the most. The bikes were most in demand from 7AM-9AM and 5PM-7PM during the week, with the majority of trips being made by Subscribers. 
To further evaluate the citi bike data, a graph displaying bike trip duration by age was created (see below). This graph shows that users with birth years between 1981-1990 and 1991-2001 were the top users.
